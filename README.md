Fun game written in pygame. Fill in the blocks with paint while the drunk farmer and his friends come chasing after you. Each level up, the farmer sobers up and gets less wobbly on his feet and comes right after you and calls more of his friends to catch you.
Get as far as you can and paint his fields before he catches you!

Cursor keys, wasd or wsop to control the pig. M to toggle music on and off. Esc to quit.

Enjoy!
